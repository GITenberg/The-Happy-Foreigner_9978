description: Fictional account of the author's experiences working as a volunteer
  driver in France during the First World War. The war had stopped. The King of England
  was in Paris, and the President of the United States was hourly expected. Humbler
  guests poured each night from the termini into the overflowing city, and sought
  anxiously for some bed, lounge-chair, or pillowed corner, in which to rest until
  the morning. Stretched upon the table in a branch of the Y.W.C.A. lay a young woman
  from England whose clothes were of brand-new khaki, and whose name was Fanny. She
  had arrived that night at the Gare du Nord at eight o'clock, and the following night
  at eight o'clock she left Paris by the Gare de l'Est.
